# Auth Feature

- [ ] Export 3 more Pages from your index.ts you should name them `LoginPage` `SignOut` `dashboard`.
- [ ] After Exposing check our `main.ts` and uncomment imports that points to your `index.ts`
- [ ] Start refactoring your code as your index will now reach more than 150 Lines of code, seperate the functionality of each pages.
